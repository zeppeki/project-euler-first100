# Bandit configuration for Project Euler first 100
# This file configures security scanning for a mathematical computation project

# Skip B101 (assert_used) warnings for Project Euler context
# Assert statements are used for:
# - Type checking and validation in mathematical algorithms
# - Ensuring algorithm correctness and edge case handling
# - Development-time debugging and verification
# These are appropriate uses in a computational mathematics context
skips = B101

# Include all Python files
include = *.py

# Exclude test files from this specific check (tests have their own assertions)
exclude_dirs = tests

# Set confidence level
confidence = HIGH

# Set severity level
severity = MEDIUM
